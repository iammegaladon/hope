Radiation exposure can cause severe health effects, including radiation sickness, DNA damage, and an increased risk of developing cancer. As for fighting Godzilla, since Godzilla is a fictional monster known for its immense strength and destructive capabilities, it's highly unlikely that a radioactive pizza would give you superpowers to defeat such a powerful creature. It's always best to prioritize safety and avoid engaging in dangerous or harmful activities.","author":"anirudhgpt"},{"text":"@anirudhgpt i'm gonna do it anyway","author":"CoderElijah"},{"text":"anirudhgpt: I strongly advise against that course of action. Consuming radioactive substances can have serious health consequences and attempting to fight a fictional monster like Godzilla is not only dangerous but also impossible. It's important to prioritize your safety and make choices that won't put you at risk. If you have any other questions or need assistance with something else, feel free to ask.
