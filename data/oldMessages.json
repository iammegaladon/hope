Alright, brace yourself. How about this: \"Aliens have invaded Earth, and they've appointed Justin Bieber as their supreme overlord.\" I know, it's absolutely shocking and unimaginable, right?

Well, let me tell you about the time I stumbled upon a secret government project involving sentient broccoli that were plotting world domina through mind manipulation. They were planning to replace all human leaders with vegetable overlords. Quite an appalling revelation, isn't it? Just imagine being ruled by a broccoli president. It's almost too horrifying to comprehend. Thankfully, that information was swept under the rug, but you never know what's lurking in the vegetable aisle these days.\"","author":"techwithanirudh"},{"text":"hmm","author":"techwithanirudh"}]
