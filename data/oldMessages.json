[{"text":"This was the output:\n```\nSure, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Steve has 45% of the number of fruits that Bob has, so he has 0.45 * 25 = 11.25 fruits.\n2. Steve decreases by 15% of Jane's fruit count every year. After the first year, he has 85% of the previous year's count, which is 0.85 * 11.25 = 9.5625 fruits.\n3. After the second year, he has 85% of the previous year's count, which is 0.85 * 9.5625 = 8.128125 fruits.\n4. After the third year, he has 85% of the previous year's count, which is 0.85 * 8.128125 = 6.90990625 fruits.\n\nSo, after 3 years, Steve will have approximately 6.91 bananas.\n```\nIDK why unexpected end of input","author":"python660"},{"text":"Fixed bug, I think","author":"9pfs"},{"text":"@anirudhgpt timeout?","author":"techwithanirudh"},{"text":"Nope, just checked","author":"9pfs"},{"text":"@anirudhgpt Hello","author":"9pfs"},{"text":"Hello!
