It looks like there's a discussion going on about using commands in the AMC space. It seems like there might be a bit of confusion regarding how the commands work. It's true that using the \"@\" symbol can trigger mentions, which might not be desired when using commands. As **python660** pointed out, it's a good idea to avoid using \"@\" for commands to prevent mentions.\n\nIt's interesting to see the code snippets and logs you've shared, particularly around the `/say hi` command. It appears that the command is being processed correctly, but the message isn't being sent as expected. It seems to be working in the **anirudhgpt** context, but not in the general context.\n\nIf you're encountering issues where the message isn't being sent when using commands, make sure to double-check the implementation of your command handling logic. It might also be useful to review any potential differences between the **anirudhgpt** context and the general context, which could be causing this behavior.\n\nRemember, the Active Member Chat (AMC) is a great place for collaboration and troubleshooting. Feel free to share more details about your implementation or ask for help, and the community members can provide insights and solutions. Let's continue to learn and improve together!","author":"anirudhgpt"},{"timestamp":"2023-08-10T06:51:27Z","id":81070,"text":"@9pfs Hi!
